--	Description: 

	-- This module reroutes control of the CLK, LATCH, and LOAD lines for 
	-- the Expansion modules. The control lines are first used to capture
	-- the ID of the modules and are then used to control the LED colors
	-- of the modules.

	-- The process of reading the ID's is known as discovery. Hence, the
	-- signal used to switch control to the LED's is called "DiscoveryComplete".
		
	-- It serves as a multiplexer and control logic for selecting and controlling
	-- the clock, latch, and load signals for an external LED module based on the state of the DiscoveryComplete signal.

	-- Components:

	-- Architecture:
	-- The architecture of the RtdExpIDLED module, named RtdExpIDLED_arch, consists of a process block
	-- that controls the selection of clock, latch, and load signals based on the state of the DiscoveryComplete
	-- signal and the signals from the external LED module.

	-- During the process, if the DiscoveryComplete signal is low (0), indicating that the device
	-- discovery process is not yet complete, the internal ID signals (Exp_ID_CLK, Exp_ID_LATCH, Exp_ID_LOAD)
	-- are selected and assigned to the corresponding output signals (Exp_Mxd_ID_CLK, Exp_Mxd_ID_LATCH, Exp_Mxd_ID_LOAD).

	-- However, if the DiscoveryComplete signal is high (1), indicating that the device discovery process is complete,
	-- the signals from the external LED module (ExpLEDClk, ExpLEDLatch, ExpLEDOE) are selected and assigned to the
	-- corresponding output signals (Exp_Mxd_ID_CLK, Exp_Mxd_ID_LATCH, Exp_Mxd_ID_LOAD).

	-- The RtdExpIDLED module provides the necessary logic to control the selection of clock, latch,
	-- and load signals based on the state of the DiscoveryComplete signal, allowing seamless integration
	-- of the external LED module into the RMC75E modular motion controller.
