--	Description: 

	-- Note that the RAM signal should have a value initialization to avoid
	-- undefined behavior in the analog module. It can be set to either 1 or 0, as long as it is not
	-- left undefined when intialized.
	
	-- Creates a 128x16 (128 words x 16 bits per word) synchronous write synchronous read, single-port RAM.

	-- The RAM128x16 module serves as a 128x16-bit random access memory (RAM) module, capable
	-- of storing and retrieving data based on provided address and control signals.

	-- Architecture:
	
	-- The architecture of the RAM128x16 module, named RAM128x16_arch, consists of the following components:

	-- The behavior of the RAM128x16 module is defined within a process block sensitive to the clk signal.
	-- The process handles both write and read operations based on the rising edge of the clock signal.

	-- During a rising edge of the clock, the module checks if we (write enable) is asserted.
	-- If so, the module writes the 16-bit data d into the memory location specified by the address a.

	-- The read_a signal is continuously updated with the current address a to ensure the correct
	-- data is read from the RAM during subsequent clock cycles.

	-- Finally, the output signal o is assigned the value stored in the
	-- RAM at the memory location specified by read_a, providing the requested 16-bit data output.

	-- The RAM128x16 module provides a reliable and efficient means of storing
	-- and retrieving data within the RMC75E modular motion controller,
	-- making it an integral component for various motion control operations.
