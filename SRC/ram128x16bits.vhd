--	Description: 

	-- Creates a 128x16 (128 words x 16 bits per word) synchronous write synchronous read, single-port RAM.

	-- The RAM128x16 module is a component of the source code for the RMC75E modular motion controller.
	-- It serves as a 128x16-bit random access memory (RAM) module, capable
	-- of storing and retrieving data based on provided address and control signals.

	-- Components:

	-- Inputs:
	-- clk: The clock signal used for synchronous operations.
	-- we: The write enable signal that controls write operations.
	-- a: The address input signal used to specify the memory location to access.
	-- d: The data input signal containing the 16-bit data to be written into the specified memory location.

	-- Outputs:
	-- o: The data output signal that provides the 16-bit data read from the specified memory location.

	-- Architecture:

	-- The architecture of the RAM128x16 module, named RAM128x16_arch, consists of the following components:

	-- ram_type: This is a defined type representing an array of 128 elements,
	-- where each element is a 16-bit std_logic_vector. It serves as the main storage for the RAM module.

	-- RAM: A signal of type ram_type, representing the actual memory storage.
	-- It is an array with 128 elements, each capable of storing a 16-bit value.

	-- read_a: A signal of type std_logic_vector(6 downto 0), used to hold the current address input for read operations.

	-- The behavior of the RAM128x16 module is defined within a process block sensitive to the clk signal.
	-- The process handles both write and read operations based on the rising edge of the clock signal.

	-- During a rising edge of the clock, the module checks if we (write enable) is asserted.
	-- If so, the module writes the 16-bit data d into the memory location specified by the address a.

	-- The read_a signal is continuously updated with the current address a to ensure the correct
	-- data is read from the RAM during subsequent clock cycles.

	-- Finally, the output signal o is assigned the value stored in the
	-- RAM at the memory location specified by read_a, providing the requested 16-bit data output.

	-- The RAM128x16 module provides a reliable and efficient means of storing
	-- and retrieving data within the RMC75E modular motion controller,
	-- making it an integral component for various motion control operations.
