--	Description: 

-- The test bench, named "DiscoverID_TB," is responsible for verifying the functionality
-- of the Design Under Test (DUT) named "DiscoverID." It provides stimulus signals,
-- monitors the DUT's behavior, and checks for expected results.
-- The test bench initializes signals, generates a clock,
-- and applies test stimuli to the DUT's inputs.
-- It also includes assertions to validate the DUT's outputs and stops
-- the simulation after a specified time.

-- The Design Under Test (DUT), named "DiscoverID," is the entity being tested.
-- It represents a module designed to perform the identification process in the RMC75E.
-- The DUT has inputs such as RESET, SysClk, SlowEnable, FPGAIDRead, ControlCardIDRead,
-- Expansion1IDRead, Expansion2IDRead, Expansion3IDRead, and Expansion4IDRead.
-- It also has outputs such as M_Card_ID_DATA, Exp_ID_DATA, MDTPresent, ANLGPresent,
-- QUADPresent, and DiscoveryComplete. The DUT's purpose is to read identification
-- information from various sources and provide the corresponding outputs,
-- indicating the presence of specific cards or modules.
